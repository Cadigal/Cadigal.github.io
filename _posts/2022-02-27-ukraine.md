**Found [this link](https://t.me/itarmyofukraine) to a telegram group while I was writing this post** (from https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/1497813622793379842)

I'm trying to think about how I can personally help Ukraine.

I'm an Australian software engineer.  
I'm not a member of Anonymous or a skilled hacker (I've got little experience with applied cyber security).

I've been getting news from:

- [YouTube (Adam Something)](https://www.youtube.com/c/adamsomething)
- [Twitter (this list)](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1494327296383021062?s=20)
- [Instagram (quentin.quarantino)](https://www.instagram.com/quentin.quarantino)

Thoughts:

- There is a [coordinated cyber attack going on against Russia](https://twitter.com/stavridisj/status/1497612824562044930?s=20&t=AJfpPp4bQftpg9kEuHsskQ), wish I could help (I'm not sure my skills are up to the task and also don't know how to get in contact)
- [Russia's invasion has disrupted Ukraine's internet](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/internet-ukraine-disrupted-russian-troops-advance-2022-02-26/).
- At the request of Ukraine's prime minister, [Elon Musk sent StarLink terminals to Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-says-starlink-active-ukraine-russian-invasion-disrupts-internet-2022-02-27/)
- [Ukranians are downloading secure and p2p messaging apps](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/02/25/ukrainians-prepping-for-internet-loss-by-getting-apps-for-offline-private-mesh-communications/), the ways these apps work should be the norm, not the exception
- Livestreams coming out of Ukraine all stopped when some infrastructure was destroyed (likely a [power station](https://twitter.com/sentdefender/status/1497288908178087937?s=20&t=AJfpPp4bQftpg9kEuHsskQ) or network switch)
- I'm assuming this disrupted local communications as well and made it hard for intra-national communications
- StarLink may have patched this hole temporarily but it's by no means a permanent solution - satellites can easily be taken out
- Web3 (crypto + decentralisation) really offers a solution to these problems at the expense of platform autocracy (which I'd usually say is good, however in light of Twitter restricting Russian account creation and not allowing Russian state-controlled media to purchase ads I'm less confident (other big tech has done similar things))
- I've been thinking about ZFS + Blob storage and IPFS for an iCloud replacement (with a personal project I'd love to build on top) and a Web3 P2P protocol for data transfer (think torrenting but instant messaging). I'll write a post about this
